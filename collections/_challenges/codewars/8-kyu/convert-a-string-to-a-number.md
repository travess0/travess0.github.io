# Convert a String to a Number!
Note: This kata is inspired by [Convert a Number to a String!](http://www.codewars.com/kata/convert-a-number-to-a-string/). Try that one too.

# Description
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

# Examples
```
"1234" --> 1234
"605"  --> 605
"1405" --> 1405
"-7" --> -7
```

# Solution
```python
def string_to_number(s):
    return int(s)
```
