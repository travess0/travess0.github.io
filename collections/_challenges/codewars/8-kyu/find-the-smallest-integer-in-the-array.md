# Find the smallest integer in the array
Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

# For example:
Given `[34, 15, 88, 2]` your solution will return `2`
Given `[34, -345, -1, 100]` your solution will return `-345`
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.
